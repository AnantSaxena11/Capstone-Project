The issue you're facing—where the transformed images appear as white canvases—likely stems from the way the sigmoid transformation is applied to pixel values.

Why Are the Images Coming Out as White?
The sigmoid function:
T 
f
​
 (x)= 
1+e 
−x
 
1
​

is highly sensitive to large values of x. Since grayscale pixel values range from 0 to 255, applying this transformation directly will yield values very close to 1 for most pixel intensities, making the entire image appear white.

Solution: Normalize the Pixel Values Before Applying Sigmoid
Instead of applying the sigmoid function directly on pixel values (0-255), normalize them to [-1,1] or [0,1] before applying the function.
